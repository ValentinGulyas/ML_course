# Ensemble Models Project
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook CA04_Ensemble_Models_GH.ipynb, which is an exploration of ensemble modeling techniques applied to a specific dataset. The project aims to compare the performance of various ensemble methods in predictive modeling.

## Overview
The notebook is structured into several sections, focusing on different ensemble models and their implementation. Here is a brief overview of the sections and the models covered:

• Data Source and Content: Introduction to the dataset used in the models.

• Building a Random Forest Model: Implementation and evaluation of a Random Forest model.

• ADABOOST: Exploration of the AdaBoost algorithm with a focus on its application and performance metrics.

• Gradient Boost: Detailed analysis of Gradient Boosting techniques and their effectiveness.

• XGB: Implementation of the XGBoost algorithm and comparison with other models.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed in your Python environment:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
xgboost
Running the Notebook
